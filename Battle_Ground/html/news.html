             <news>Hi everyone,</news><br><br>
             
             
             <news>This update has a lot of exciting additions and balances. Tactical Map Markers have been added for better communication between Squad and Duo teams. We’ve added more spawn kit options in Custom Matches and Camp Jackal as a playable map in War Mode: Conquest. Our largest focus in this patch was rebalancing aspects of Vikendi. Following feedback on our first round of Vikendi rebalancing, we have tweaked the spawn rates to better equip players for long range fights.</news><br><br>
             
             <news>In addition to info on the updates, with Survivor Pass 3: Wild Card winding down we’ve got details on how long you have to collect your XP and rewards, so definitely jump in there for the last few weeks and complete as many missions as you can.</news><br><br>
             
             <news>We’ve got several new UI improvements and general Quality of Life improvements across the game. You can get all the details on the changes and additions made in Update #29 below.</news><br><br>

            <h4>Vikendi 2nd Rebalance</h4><br>
             <news style="text-align:center;padding:0px;"><img style="width:50%;position: relative;left:20%" src="../img/news1.png"></news><br><br>
                                                                                                                                    
             <new>
             With this update we made Vikendi a more balanced sniper haven with increased long guns and the addition of the MK47 Mutant for that extra burst of firepower. Getting through all those snipers will be a bit easier with better cover, which the extra 4-wheel drive vehicles will provide better than snowbikes. Read on for more details about the Vikendi rebalance.

                    Blue zone adjustments
                </li>
                 <li>
                     To support a wider variety of gameplay experiences around Vikendi, the initial safe zone will now be placed in more varied locations and the waiting time between certain blue zone phases has been reduced.
                     <ul>
                        <li>Phase 1 safe zone now spawns in more varied locations.</li>
                        <li>Waiting time between early and late blue zone phases has been decreased slightly.</li>
                        <li>Overall match duration subsequently reduced by 1 minute and 30 seconds.</li>

                         <li>
                             Vehicle spawn rate has been changed to facilitate the new blue zone settings.
                             <ul class="circle">
                                <li>
                                    Increased four-wheel drive vehicle spawn ratio in relation to Snowbikes and Snowmobiles.

                 <li>Item spawn rate adjustment</li>
                 <li>
                    We have adjusted weapon spawn rates to help facilitate more medium and long-range engagements. Adjustments to available attachments have also been made to offer players more options.
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                            Adjustments to item spawns on Vikendi:

                                <li>DMR spawns increased by 2x</li>

                 <li>Cave balance adjustment</li>
                 <li>
                     Since the Secret Cave is no longer much of a secret, we have adjusted the loot within to balance it more closely to other areas of Vikendi to improve the gameplay experience, while still offering good loot.
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                            Care Packages will no-longer spawn in the cave.

                                    High quality non-crate loot will still spawn in this location.

                            </ul>
                         </li>
                         <li>Increased variety of items spawned in the cave.</li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Item pool changes
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added MK47 Mutant, Halfgrip, Thumbgrip and Laser Sight.</li>

                    On April 22nd, our Weapon Mastery team descended on Reddit’s /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS subreddit for an AMA (Ask Me Anything) about the new progression system they developed. Members of PUBG’s Mastery team had a blast getting your feedback and fielding questions about the new rewards and mechanics the Mastery system brings to the game. Questions ranged from finding out how a player can earn medals to bypassing asking a question at all and suggesting what charms should come next for players that max out their armory.

                 <news>A. Nope! No time limit to unlock charms or level up tiers, Weapon Mastery is a permanent system with no resets. Oh.. and all Weapon Mastery rewards are free to earn and cannot be purchased.</news><br><br>
                 
                <h4>Q. Is getting mastery levels on certain weapons easier?</h4><br>
                 <news>A. We have made an effort to balance Weapon Mastery in such a way that progression will be equal for all guns. It’s not about which weapons are better, but which weapons you use and enjoy putting time into using.</news><br><br>
                 
                  <h4>Q. When a player maxes out a weapon will all stats be wiped and I’ll have to start over?</h4><br>
                 <news>A. Weapon Mastery progress will not be wiped.</news><br><br>
                 
                 <h4>Q. Since Weapon Mastery is a feature that allows players to check their gun stats and earn rewards based on their skills, will others be able to actually see this “skill” I have or is it personal and hidden from others?</h4><br>

                       >A. We designed a system that allowed you to show off these items to other players, but it didn’t feel quite right. We held off on shipping it while we go back to the drawing board to think of better ways to display your emblems to your friends, and maybe even your enemies. Giving players the opportunity to show off their accomplishments and personalize their looks are very high on our priority list.

                  <h4>Q. Am I going to be matched with the players who are at the same mastery level with me?</h4><br>
                 <news>A. Mastery level will have no effect on matchmaking.

                 <h4>Q. When can we expect it on Xbox and PS4?</h4><br>
